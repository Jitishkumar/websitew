# Important Instructions

To fix the issue with private account detection, please run the following SQL files in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. `supabase/get_user_privacy_function.sql` - Creates a function that allows users to check if another user has a private account
2. `supabase/user_settings_visibility.sql` - Creates a policy that allows users to view the private_account status of other users

## Steps to Run SQL Files

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Open each file and run the SQL commands
4. Verify that the function and policy have been created successfully

## Explanation of the Issue

The issue occurs because the Row Level Security (RLS) policy for the `user_settings` table only allows users to view their own settings. This means when a user tries to check if another user has a private account, they get `null` even if the settings exist.

The new SQL files create:
1. A function `get_user_privacy` that bypasses RLS to check if a user has a private account
2. A policy that allows users to view the `private_account` status of other users

After running these SQL files, the application should be able to correctly detect private accounts and redirect to the appropriate screen.
